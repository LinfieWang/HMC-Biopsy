## 📄 Abstract

Ultrasound (US) imaging has gained widespread application in guiding biopsy procedures. However, conventional manual US-guided biopsy remains limited by occupational exposure risks, limited accuracy in vessel and lesion identification, and strong dependence on operator proficiency. To address these challenges, we propose a tumor biopsy framework centered on a tele-assisted robotic system. The framework implements coordinated master–slave manipulation using a Kalman-filter-enhanced proportional–derivative (PD) control algorithm, and integrates a real-time segmentation–based vision module to localize tumors and avoid blood vessels with high precision. At the end effector, a two-degree-of-freedom (2-DOF) remote center-of-motion (RCM) mechanism enables concurrent operation of the US probe and biopsy needle within confined spaces. In addition, a geometric quantification strategy based on spatial calibration strategy is introduced to support millimeter-level error assessment. Performance was evaluated in silicone phantoms across three puncture modes. Compared with conventional manual puncture, the robotic system achieved a mean positioning error of 2.00±0.54 mm (a 47.8% improvement) and an angular error of 4.81°±1.10° (n 36.3% improvement), meeting clinical requirements for biopsy guidance. These results indicate that the proposed framework can substantially enhance procedural accuracy while reducing dependence on operator skill and clinical experience, thereby holding promise for safer and more reliable US-guided biopsy.
